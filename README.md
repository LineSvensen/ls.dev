# 💻 My Portfolio Website – Line Svensen

Welcome! This is the codebase for my **personal portfolio website**, built as part of the Noroff Front-end development curriculum.

---

### ✨ Project Overview

This portfolio represents me as a developer – my personality, my tech skills, and some of the projects I've worked on.

I've chosen a **dark theme** with vibrant highlights (especially pink 💖 – my favorite color). Subtle **animations** and smooth transitions help make the experience engaging while still clean and minimal.

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used

- **VSCode** – Development environment
- **React** – JavaScript UI library
- **React Router DOM** – Routing between pages
- **Zustand** – Lightweight global state management
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Font Awesome / React Icons** – Iconography
- **Vercel** – Deployment platform

Creating this React-based portfolio was both fun and a valuable learning experience. I challenged myself with animations, responsiveness, clean code structure, and state management using Zustand. I'm proud of the final result and excited to continue evolving it.
